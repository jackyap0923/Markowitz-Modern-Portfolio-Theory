# Markowitz-Modern-Portfolio-Theory
This Python code provides a versatile framework for portfolio optimization using the classic Markowitz model and Mean-Variance Optimization (MVT). It leverages financial data from Yahoo Finance and implements various portfolio optimization techniques.

Key Features:
  Markowitz Class:
   Computes expected returns, covariance matrix, Sharpe Ratio, CAPM expected return, and alpha/beta using linear regression.
  MVT Class (inherits from Markowitz):
   Implements minimum variance portfolio, minimum variance portfolio with a constraint on expected return, tangent portfolio, and plots the efficient frontier.
Usage:
  Initialization:
   Provide lists of tickers, prices, and quantities to create a portfolio object.
  Portfolio Analysis:
   Access various portfolio statistics such as expected returns, beta, Sharpe Ratio, CAPM expected return, and alpha/beta.
  Efficient Frontier:
   Visualize the efficient frontier and identify optimal portfolio positions.
